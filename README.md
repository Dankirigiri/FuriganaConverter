**FIRST OFFICIAL PROGRAM**
--------------------------------

This is a program I've created. It's a furigana converter, or better said a kana converter. It works with the _JMDict_'s database and _vanilla JavaScript_ with a backend and a frontend. It still in a beta phase, in a very basic and only functional phase. I have finished the initial 1.0V, and now this is the V1.2 version of the app. It's not over, but I'm happy with the current results it throws. 

**How's it used:**
----------------------------------
I've created an execute.bat file. I know that it will only work in Windows, I'm going to fix that, but for the moment this is the only way it works. However, you can simply type "npx nodemon js/backend/index.js" in your cmd or PowerShell to execute the backend server. This is necessary for the furigana converter to work.

For executing this application it's necessary to install NodeJS, or it will not work: https://nodejs.org/ (download the recommended version)
