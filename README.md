**FIRST OFFICIAL PROGRAM**
--------------------------------

This is a program I've created. It's a furigana converter, or better said a kana converter. It works with the _JMDict_'s database and _vanilla JavaScript_ with a backend and a frontend. It still in a beta phase, in a very basic and only functional phase. I would say it's in V1.0, and needs _more development_. I will constantly update for more features and better code.

**How's it used:**
----------------------------------
I've created an execute.bat file. I know that it will only work in Windows, I'm going to fix that, but for the moment this is the only way it works. However, you can simply type "npx nodemon js/backend/index.js" in your cmd or PowerShell to execute the backend server. This is necessary for the furigana converter to work.

**Bugs:**
---------------------------------
- Sometimes it doesn't show the correct readings of a word
- It can't actually convert a sentence fully into kana (this could be fixed later)


**Futures:**
---------------------------------
* More compatibility in other OS (this will be achieved by using other frameworks)+
